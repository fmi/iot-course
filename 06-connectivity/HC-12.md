# HC-12

## Short description
The HC-12 is a wireless serial port communication module that is very useful, extremely powerful and easy to use. It allows communication up to 1.8km distance in open air.

## Task

You have to implement an receiver and a transmitter.

### Transmitter
In this mode, the device will transmit in the air some data based on user activities or random generation. Your task is to send '1' when the `user` button is pressed, otherwise '0'.

Here is a simple skeleton for the transmitter
```
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>

const int RX = D2, TX = D3;   // RX and TX pins of HC-12 module
SoftwareSerial HC12(TX, RX);

void setup() {
  HC12.begin(9600);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  bool sendOne = ((millis() % 5) == 0);  // TODO-> use button, not millis()
  Serial.print("Sending: ");
  Serial.println(sendOne);
  if (sendOne) {
    HC12.write('1');
  } else {
    HC12.write('0');
  }
  delay(881);
}

```

### Receiver
In this mode, the device will receive data from the air. Your task is to power on the built-in LED when '1' arrived and power it off when '0' arrived.

Here is a simple skeleton for the receiver

```
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>

const int RX = D2, TX = D3;   // RX and TX pins of HC-12 module
SoftwareSerial HC12(TX, RX);

void setup() {
  HC12.begin(9600);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  char s;
  if (HC12.available();) {
    s = HC12.read();
    while (HC12.available()) {
      HC12.read();
    }
    Serial.println(s);  // logs the received data on the serial output
    //TODO: make some actions, for example blink the LED based on received data
    if ( s == '1') {
    } else if ( s == '0') {
    }
  }
  delay(20);
}
```
